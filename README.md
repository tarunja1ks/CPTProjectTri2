# Conventional Flask Portfolio Starter

Use this project to create a Flask Servr.

Runtime link: <https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/>
GitHub link: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio

## Conventional way to get started

> Quick steps that can be used with MacOS, WSL Ubuntu, or Ubuntu; this uses Python 3.9 or later as a prerequisite.

- Open a Terminal, clone project and cd to project area

```bash
mkdir ~/vscode; cd ~/vscode

git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git

cd flask_portfolio
```

- Install python dependencies for Flask, etc.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run from Terminal without VSCode

  - Setup database and init data
  
  ```bash
    ./migrate.sh
    ```

  - Run python server from command line without VSCode

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Open project in VSCode

- Prepare VSCode and run

  - From Terminal run VSCode

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

  - Open Setting: Ctl-Shift P or Cmd-Shift
    - Search Python: Select Interpreter
    - Match interpreter to `which python` from terminal

  - Select main.py and Play button
  - Try Play button and try to Debug

### Files and Directories in this Project

These are some of the key files and directories in this project

README.md: This file contains instructions for setting up the necessary tools and cloning the project. A README file is a standard component of all properly set up GitHub projects.

requirements.txt: This file lists the dependencies required to turn this Python project into a Flask/Python project. It may also include other backend dependencies, such as dependencies for working with a database.

main.py: This Python source file is used to run the project. Running this file starts a Flask web server locally on localhost. During development, this is the file you use to run, test, and debug the project.

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml: These files are used to run and test the project in a Docker container. They allow you to simulate the project’s deployment on a server, such as an AWS EC2 instance. Running these files helps ensure that your tools and dependencies work correctly on different machines.

instances: This directory is the standard location for storing data files that you want to remain on the server. For example, SQLite database files can be stored in this directory. Files stored in this location will persist after web application restart, everyting outside of instances will be recreated at restart.

static: This directory is the standard location for files that you want to be cached by the web server. It is typically used for image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.) or JavaScript files that remain constant during the execution of the web server.

api: This directory contains code that receives and responds to requests from external servers. It serves as the interface between the external world and the logic and code in the rest of the project.

model: This directory contains files that implement the backend functionality for many of the files in the api directory. For example, there may be files in the model directory that directly interact with the database.

templates: This directory contains files and subdirectories used to support the home and error pages of the website.

.gitignore: This file specifies elements to be excluded from version control. Files are excluded when they are derived and not considered part of the project’s original source. In the VSCode Explorer, you may notice some files appearing dimmed, indicating that they are intentionally excluded from version control based on the rules defined in .gitignore.

model/users.py:

This Python module defines SQLAlchemy models for managing users and their designs within a SQLite database. It includes classes for User and Design, each with methods for CRUD operations.

Design Class
- Represents a design entity in the database.
- Attributes include name, type, content, userID, likes, dislikes, and description.
- Methods include create, read, update, and delete for CRUD operations.

User Class
- Represents a user entity in the database.
- Attributes include id, _name, _uid, _password, _type, _dob, and images.
- Methods include create, read, update, delete, and helper methods for password management.
- Includes relationships with the Design class for managing user designs.

Database Initialization
- Provides a function initUsers() to create test users and designs in the database.
- Uses SQLAlchemy's session management for committing changes and handling errors.

# Remember to run ./migrate-sh to initialize database before running Flask backend with python main.py
